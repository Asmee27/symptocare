## Overview
🩺 SymptoCare – Smart Symptom Checker

SymptoCare is a simple and intelligent web application that helps users understand their health symptoms by providing possible condition predictions. It uses an interactive form where users select symptoms, and the system analyzes them to suggest potential illnesses along with basic precautions. The goal is to offer a quick, user-friendly first-step health assessment—not a medical diagnosis.

Features:

Easy symptom selection

Smart condition prediction

Suggested precautions

Clean, responsive UI
